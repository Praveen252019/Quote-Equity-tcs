1.Initially, I imported the dataset into my project.
2.Next, I carefully identified the dependent and independent variables within the dataset.
3.I decided to delete the "series" column because it contained the same value throughout, rendering it redundant and unnecessary for analysis.
4.I then set the index of the dataset using the "data" column to ensure proper alignment and referencing of records.
5.Afterward, I removed all commas from the dataset to eliminate any potential formatting issues or errors in data processing.
6.Finally, I thoroughly cleaned the dataset to ensure it was ready for further analysis and modeling.

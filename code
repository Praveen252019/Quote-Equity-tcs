import pandas as pd

# Load the dataset
df = pd.read_csv("/content/Quote-Equity-TCS-EQ-22-06-2024-to-22-07-2024.csv")

# Drop the 'series' column
df.drop('series', axis=1, inplace=True)

# Set the 'Date' column as the index
df.set_index('Date', inplace=True)

# Remove commas from the entire DataFrame
df = df.replace(',', '', regex=True)


Explanation:
Removing Commas: The line df.replace(',', '', regex=True) replaces all commas in the DataFrame with an empty string, effectively removing them. This is applied to the entire DataFrame.
This will clean up your dataset by ensuring there are no commas, which might otherwise cause issues in numerical data.





















1.Initially, I imported the dataset into my project.
2.Next, I carefully identified the dependent and independent variables within the dataset.
3.I decided to delete the "series" column because it contained the same value throughout, rendering it redundant and unnecessary for analysis.
4.I then set the index of the dataset using the "data" column to ensure proper alignment and referencing of records.
5.Afterward, I removed all commas from the dataset to eliminate any potential formatting issues or errors in data processing.
6.Finally, I thoroughly cleaned the dataset to ensure it was ready for further analysis and modeling.
